#### material-ui
I choose material-ui as the front end UI library for several reasons. First of
all, it's one of several popular react front end UI library like Bootstrap and
Ant. Moreover, it follows the Material Design methodology. Generally say, it's
more modern and contains good graphic UI design philosophy. Last one, personally
I use it more often than other UI libraries.
#### redux-saga
- immutable
- react-redux
- react-router-dom
#### react-google-maps && use-places-autocomplete
These two libraries are used for making the map page. React-google-maps/api is
used for calling different google map related servies, like GeoCoding service,
Directions service and Places service. Whereas, use-places-autocomplete is mainly
used for achieving the autocomplete of address.
